I wrote the code for my website in Visual Studio Code. Hopefully, you will be able to open the zip
file and access the HTML files to each page and demo the website yourself. However, if that
doesn’t work, I’ve included a video run-through of the website. I’ll also include the plaintext of
each page here for reading at your leisure.

“maxton santos is a denver-based multi-instrumentalist, songwriter, and producer. specializing in
guitar, bass, and drums, maxton can both write and play nearly any part to any song in both live
and studio situations; their training and versatility with instruments has also been a boon when
writing parts for and playing instruments outside of the scope of their formal training, such as
synthesizer or banjo. their production and session experience ranges from heartstring-tugging,
folky americana, to fast-paced, modern jazz, to ambient and experimental beatmaking, to
cutting-edge alternative rock, and many genres between.”
“currently, maxton pursues a bachelor of science degree in audio production at the University of
Colorado Denver. they play bass for Porridge and Yes Baby, and they play guitar and sing in
General Nuisance.”
"i am devoted to musical exploration and i embrace intuition to maintain artistic integrity in every
song. i will work closely with you as a musician and as a friend, taking into account everyone’s
unique experiences in music and life. the best music emerges from an atmosphere of honesty
and emotional connection among all parties."
